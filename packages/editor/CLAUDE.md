# Bicamrl Editor Package

## Overview

The editor package contains frontend implementations for interacting with the Bicamrl server. It's structured to support multiple UI paradigms while sharing core logic.

## Structure

```
editor/
â”œâ”€â”€ core/          # UI-agnostic state management
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ state      # Application state definition
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ actions    # All possible user actions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ reducer    # Pure state transitions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ effects    # Side effects (API calls)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ tests/     # Comprehensive state tests
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ gui/           # Iced-based graphical interface
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ api        # HTTP/SSE client
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app        # Main application using core
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ types      # API type definitions
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ tui/           # Terminal UI (future)
```

## Design Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Core logic is completely separate from UI rendering
2. **Testability**: All state transitions can be tested without any UI
3. **Reusability**: Same core powers GUI, TUI, CLI, etc.
4. **Type Safety**: Strong typing throughout with Rust

## Core State Management

The `core` package implements a Redux-like state machine:
- Actions represent user intents
- Reducer is a pure function (testable!)
- Effects handle async operations
- State is immutable

This means we can:
- Test every possible user interaction
- Replay action sequences
- Debug by examining action logs
- Ensure consistent behavior across UIs

## Current Status

- âœ… Core state management with full test coverage
- âœ… Iced-based GUI with interaction support
- âœ… SSE integration for real-time updates
- âœ… Performance optimized (98% fewer requests)
- âœ… Tool permission flow with Approve/Deny UI
- âœ… Ubuntu-style interaction naming
- âœ… Unicode spinner with custom colors
- ðŸ“‹ TUI implementation
- ðŸ“‹ Richer interaction editing (multi-part content)
- ðŸ“‹ Advanced review workflow UI

## Running Tests

```bash
# Test core state management
bun run test:core

# Run GUI
bun bicky
```

## Development Rules

Follow the main project's communication style: Be direct and ruthlessly honest. No pleasantries or unnecessary acknowledgments. Quality and accuracy over agreeableness.
