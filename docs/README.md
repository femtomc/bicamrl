## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Read [PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md](./PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md) for development rules
2. Check [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) to understand the system
3. Follow [CODE_QUALITY.md](./CODE_QUALITY.md) for code standards
4. Run tests as described in [TESTING.md](./TESTING.md)

## üìä Key Metrics

From our performance optimizations:
- **98% reduction** in HTTP requests (3,600 ‚Üí 60 per minute)
- **65% lower** average latency
- **Real-time** updates via SSE
- **Scales to 100+** concurrent clients
